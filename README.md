# Hi there 👋 I'm Anish
I'm Anish, holding a Master's in Supply Chain Management from SRH Berlin University of Applied Sciences. 
With 3 years of experience in project management and business process digitalization, I'm currently transitioning my career to data science through a 4-month intensive bootcamp at WBS Coding School, Berlin.
My interests include data analysis and visualization, as well as low-code development.

👩‍💻 I'm currently working on: Data cleaning & transforming using Python's pandas and plotting graphs using Matplotlib & Seaborn

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on: Data ETL and visualization projects

⚡️ Fun fact: The term "data wrangling," which refers to the process of cleaning and organizing raw data, originated from the cowboy slang "wrangling," which means to manage and round up livestock.

## Skills:

🧮 **Tableau, Power BI**

📱**MS Power Platform**
